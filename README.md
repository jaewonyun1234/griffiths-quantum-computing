# Quantum Mechanics with Qiskit: Griffiths Edition

This repository contains code and Jupyter notebooks for quantum computing simulations based on selected topics from "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 2nd Edition" by David J. Griffiths. The goal is to bridge theoretical quantum mechanics with practical quantum computing implementations, making textbook concepts interactive and computational[web:50][web:41][web:54].

## Features

- Time-dependent simulations and measurement statistics
- Examples mapped directly from textbook exercises

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Qiskit
- Jupyter Notebook
